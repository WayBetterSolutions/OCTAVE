"""
Shared volume curve + dispatcher for all audio outputs.

OCTAVE maps the UI volume percent (0–100) to a linear audio volume (0.0–1.0)
through a quadratic curve (y = x²). This gives a more natural perceptual
response than linear at low volumes. Every audio output in the app must use
this same curve or they will drift out of sync when the user moves the slider.

Before this module existed, the curve was hardcoded in ~9 call sites across
main.py and QML. If the curve ever changed, every site had to change in
lockstep. This module centralizes both the math and the dispatch.

Call sites should use VolumeController.applyVolume() whenever possible —
that's the single entry point that keeps settings, local media, Spotify,
phone mirror, and ESP32 feedback all in sync.
