OCTAVE is an open-source infotainment system. A carputer you actually own. Rip out your factory head unit and bolt a Raspberry Pi to your dash, run it on a laptop in a project car, or sideload it onto an Android tablet. It plays your music, talks to your car over OBD-II, and themes itself to your album art.

If you've poked at **Crankshaft, OpenAuto Pro, or AGL** before, OCTAVE lives in the same neighborhood — closer to a hackable foundation than a polished product. Two backends ship side by side, C++/Qt and Python/PySide6, so you can fork whichever one you're already fluent in.

---

## Why OCTAVE

Stock head units age out fast. Aftermarket units lock you in. Android Auto and CarPlay are great until you want to do something the manufacturer didn't sign off on.

OCTAVE is the third option: a stack you build, modify, and run on whatever hardware you want. If you've ever wanted to wire a rotary encoder to your dash, throw a custom OBD gauge on screen, or theme your UI to match your album art in real time, this is the project for you.

It's not really a product. It's more like vanilla Minecraft — I'll keep the base build healthy and supported, but the amount of customization baked in means no two OCTAVE installs are going to look the same. Themes, dashboards, layouts, hardware bindings, gauges, sensors, the lot. And if you want to go further than the built-in knobs allow, the whole thing is yours to fork.

## Who This Is For

- **The Pi tinkerer.** You've got a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, a touchscreen, and a free weekend. You want a real infotainment stack to hack on, not a kiosk wrapped around a browser tab.
- **The factory-head-unit refugee.** Your 2008 Civic / E46 / Tacoma / van came with something terrible (or nothing at all), and you'd rather wire a tablet into the dash than drop $900 on a double-DIN.
- **The Android Auto / CarPlay defector.** Those are fine until you want to do something the manufacturer didn't sign off on. OCTAVE is the "do whatever you want" option.
- **The OBD-II data nerd.** You want live gauges, custom dashboards, and 50+ PIDs on screen without paying a subscription.
- **The van-build / overlander / project-car person.** You need an interface that survives being rebuilt three times and fits hardware nobody else supports.

## How It Compares

| | OCTAVE | Crankshaft | OpenAuto Pro | Stock Android Auto |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Open source | yes (MIT) | yes | partial | no |
| Runs without a phone | yes | no (AA projection) | no (AA projection) | no |
| Built-in OBD-II + custom gauges | yes | no | limited | no |
| Themable / forkable UI | fully (QML) | limited | limited | no |
| Local music + Spotify + downloads | yes | via phone | via phone | via phone |
| Desktop dev loop | yes (Win/macOS/Linux) | Pi only | Pi only | n/a |

If you want a head unit that runs **on its own** instead of a screen that mirrors your phone, OCTAVE is the one.

## Get OCTAVE

The fastest way to try OCTAVE is to grab the pre-built binary for your OS from the [Releases](https://github.com/WayBetterSolutions/OCTAVE/releases) page and give it a spin — no toolchain, no build, no Python venv. One installer per platform:

- **Windows:** `OCTAVE-<version>-windows-x86_64.exe` — run the installer.
- **macOS:** `OCTAVE-<version>-macos.dmg` — open, drag to Applications.
- **Linux:** `OCTAVE-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` — `chmod +x` and run. Works on Ubuntu 22.04+, Debian, Mint, Fedora, openSUSE, and Arch.
  - Arch users may need `fuse2`: `sudo pacman -S fuse2`. Alternative without FUSE: `./OCTAVE-*.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run`.
- **Android:** `OCTAVE-<version>-android-arm64-v8a.apk` — sideload (the released APK uses a per-build keystore, so updates require uninstalling the previous version).

If you'd rather build it yourself, hack on the code, or run from a checkout, keep reading.

## Building from source

If you just want to run the app, use the pre-built download above. Building from source is for hacking on OCTAVE — the Python backend is the fastest dev loop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waybettersolutions/octave.git
cd octave
python setup.py
```

`setup.py` detects your OS, installs dependencies, builds a virtualenv, and launches the app. Pass `--no-run` to install without launching.

After setup:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate            # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py                       # normal run
python main.py --debug               # verbose logging
python -m dev.main_dev               # simulated OBD + keyboard controls
```

### Running the C++ Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build -j
./build/octave
```

Full build matrix (9 targets including iOS, Android, Flatpak, and app store variants) lives in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

### YouTube downloads failing? Check your VPN first.

**99% of the time the fix is to turn off your VPN.** YouTube's bot detection blocklists most VPN exit IPs (NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Mullvad, ProtonVPN, etc. — they're shared with thousands of automated tools), and every download will fail with *"Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"* until you reconnect on a residential IP. If you need to stay on a VPN, switch to a residential-IP plan or a dedicated-IP exit node.

If turning off the VPN isn't an option (geo-restricted regions, privacy requirements), you can authenticate with your YouTube account via cookies as a fallback:

1. Install the **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY** extension in any Chromium-based browser:
   - Desktop: Chrome / Brave / Edge / Vivaldi.
   - Android: **Kiwi Browser** or **Brave** (Chrome on Android doesn't support extensions).
2. Log into <https://www.youtube.com> in that browser.
3. Click the extension's icon while on a YouTube tab → **Export → cookies.txt**.
4. Save (or rename) the file to `youtube_cookies.txt` in your **Downloads** folder:
   - **Linux / macOS:** `~/Downloads/youtube_cookies.txt`
   - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\youtube_cookies.txt`
   - **Android:** `/storage/emulated/0/Download/youtube_cookies.txt` (visible as `Internal storage / Download / youtube_cookies.txt` in any file manager)
5. Restart OCTAVE — every download will now use those cookies. Cookies usually stay valid for weeks.

OCTAVE detects the file automatically — no settings to configure. If you don't have the file, downloads still work for any video that isn't currently walled by YouTube on your network.

## Two backends, one frontend

This is the part I care about most.

OCTAVE ships **two parallel backends**, C++ / Qt 6 and Python / PySide6, both driving the same QML frontend. Not because the project needs both, but because **you** might. The whole reason it exists in two languages is so the next person to fork OCTAVE can pick up the side they already speak and start building.

- Love C++? `src/` is yours. Performance, app stores, mobile — that's the side that ships natively.
- Live in Python? `backend/` is yours. Want to wire up a weird sensor on a Pi at 2am with a REPL open? Done in 20 lines.

The frontend doesn't know or care which one is running. Mod whichever side you want, ship to whoever you want.

You don't have to fork to make OCTAVE yours — most of the customization is just settings, themes, and dashboards you build inside the app. But if you do want to fork and ship something I'd never have thought of, the wild rigs and weird hardware ports are the part I'm most excited to see.

## System Requirements

- **Python** 3.8+ (for the Python backend) / **Qt 6** + **CMake 3.16+** (for C++)
- **OS:** Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, Linux (Debian / Arch / Fedora), Raspberry Pi OS, Android

## Roadmap

A few of the bigger things in flight — full plans live under [`TODO/`](TODO/):

- **Drag-and-drop dashboard editor** — Tony Hawk create-a-park, but for OBD gauges. See [`TODO/dashboards-roadmap.md`](TODO/dashboards-roadmap.md).
- **Native C++ Android port** — App Store / Play Store distribution. See [`TODO/android-cpp-port.md`](TODO/android-cpp-port.md).
- **In-app error notification UI** — surface backend issues without diving into log files.
- **Expanded test coverage** — beyond the current smoke suite.

## Documentation

The wiki covers everything — architecture, every backend manager, every frontend page, settings reference, hardware setup, build guides, the gauge authoring spec — start at [`wiki/index.html`](wiki/index.html). For building gauges and dashboards specifically, [`docs/GAUGE_AUTHORING.md`](docs/GAUGE_AUTHORING.md) is the source of truth.
